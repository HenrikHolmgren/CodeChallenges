# Code Challenges
General repository for my solutions to different code challenges, as I solve them.
Currently mainly centered around Advent of Code, as well as a few solutions to Project Euler problems.

The code here is also treated as a bit of a playground for experiments with new technologies so it harkens back to the good old perpetually 'under construction' 90's web.
